# twiddle - the most efficient coding agent in the universe

This is `twiddle`, and we're on a mission to build the best and most efficient coding agent in the universe.

## Goals/Implementation Principles
- Zero dependencies (minus stdlib)
- Hyper-efficient, down to every bit
- Unreasonably effective
- Simple/concise implementation - easier to reason about.
- Follow the zen of zig!
- The Agent should be as autonomous as possible as safely as possible

## Evaluating Performance
- We'll use terminalbench to evaluate Agent effectiveness.

## Development

- Always run `zlint` after making changes.
